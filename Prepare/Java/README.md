# HackerRank: Prepare > Java
These are my solutions to the HackRank problems under:

## Java Certificate
After completing the HackerRank problems I took the __Java (Basic) Assessment__ and gained my certificate:
[Java (Basic) Certificate.pdf](./Java%20(Basic)%20Certificate.pdf)<br />
(___Note__: This can be verified at: https://www.hackerrank.com/certificates/bd454d930763_)

As of now there is no more advanced Java assessment that can be taken on HackerRank.
